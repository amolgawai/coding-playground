#+AUTHOR: Amol Gawai
#+STARTUP: Overview
* Introduction
Sample code for popular useful libraries and frameworks. All configuration of the libraries is done in the main CMakeLists.txt and used in the sample application.

- [ericniebler/range-v3: Range library for C++14/17/20, basis for C++20's std::ranges](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3)
* Building and Running
To configure the build run following at `sample_app` directory
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja
#+END_SRC
This will create build files in the build directory
Build the application by typing following
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cmake --build build
#+END_SRC
Run the application
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
build/SampleApp --help
#+END_SRC
