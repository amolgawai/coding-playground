#+TITLE: Unit Test Frameworks
#+STARTUP: overview
#+AUTHOR: Amol Gawai
* Introduction
Unit testing in C++ can be achieved with the help of external frameworks as there is no in-built support. Following are the frameworks that I have chosen to learn
1. [[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/libs/test/doc/html/index.html][Boost Test Library]]
2. [[https://github.com/google/googletest][GoogleTest]]
3. [[https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2][Catch2]]
4. [[https://github.com/doctest/doctest][DocTest]]
5. [[https://boost-ext.github.io/ut/][Boost.UT]]
* Overview
The project for implementing the unit tests using all frameworks is taken from [[https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_50_0/libs/test/doc/html/tutorials/new-year-resolution.html][Boost.Test Unit Test Tutorial]]
